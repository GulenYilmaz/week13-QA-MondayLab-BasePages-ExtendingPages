Base Pages & Extending Pages
Introduction
In this lab, you’ll be creating base pages and extending pages based on previous websites you’ve tested.

Instructions
Setup
Create a folder for this lab.

Run npm init -y to initialize a package.json.

You are going to be writing automation tests, install the pacakges you’ll need using npm i. (Hint: if you’re having trouble remembering all of them, go look at some previous lab exercises.)

Create a page olbjects folder in your lab folder, and then a file for your base page in that folder.

Base Pages
Look through your previous automation labs and demos, specifically at the tests and the page objects (keep these open, you’ll reference them in the next section as well).

Identify the functions/methods that are common between all of them.

Add those methods to your base page.

Extending Pages
Take all previous and page objects and convert them into extending pages to link to your base page.

Wrap Up
Add a .txt or .md file to your folder to answer the following prompts.

Compare and contrast your page objects and base page files by creating a list of pros and cons for each.

Which method do you like more and why?

Which one do you see yourself using more in the future?

Make sure to create a GitHub repo and push your work to it.
